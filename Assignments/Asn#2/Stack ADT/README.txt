The balanced expression program has been created to check to if an expression is balanced or not
using the implementation of a stack.

The following methods have been created:

bool isMatch() (Helper function)
-Checks if the pair of bracket operators are match

bool is Balanced()
-Check if the expression if balanced

Attributes:
String expression
-Stores the value inputed by the user

User inputs an expression and the methods return true or false

if the input is: {a}
The program will return a balanced expression

else if the input is {{2+2)
The program will return false as the expression is not closed


Program loops until the user the provides exit for the program
Help function is provided if more information is needed on how to use the program

A Makefile has provided that compiles and cleans the working directory
