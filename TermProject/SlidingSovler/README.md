User Manuel:\
The program has already been initialized for a goal configuration of 12345678\
If you wish to change the goal configuration, the program will enable you to do so after you initialize the board\
\
1. Input the numbers you wish to set up as your start board (## 0-9)\
    If you put a duplicate number, it will reboot to the start and ask you to retype the numbers\
\
2. The program will configure the board title and then prompt you to solve the puzzle\
\
3.  Be patient, longer input takes time and the program will output all the possible combinations.\
     The program may take up to 3min to print the results.\
4. If you wish to try another input, the program will prompt you again\
